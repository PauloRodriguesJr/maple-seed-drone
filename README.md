# maple-seed-drone
This repository shares the code used to fly a simple Maple Seed Drone,  which was developed in the UFABC course "Engenharia Unificada" or "Unified Enginnering", taught in  the second trimester of 2019.

The system uses two Arduinos, the first used as Maple Seed Drone controller, and the second, as RC controller.
